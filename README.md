## Description

The page about me is the first website I wrote.
It was created for the [youcode course](https://youcode.pl/frontend-developer/).
The purpose of the website is to consolidate and at the same time show my skills in the field of HTML, CSS, JS.
When writing the code, I put special emphasis on the use of accepted conventions and good practices.

The creator of the course, [Krzysztof Dąbrowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dabrowskisoftware),
an experienced Senior Software Engineer, watches over the correctness of my work.
